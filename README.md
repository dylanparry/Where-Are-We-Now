# Where Are We Now?

A simple Fabric mod for Minecraft that changes the map item to always show player icons similar to the legacy console edition. Also renders player icons with a color to match their team and removes framed map icons. This is a fork of [Where Are We Now](https://github.com/nanorover59/Where-Are-We-Now)
